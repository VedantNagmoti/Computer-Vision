## 1.basics: OpenCV Fundamentals

This folder contains foundational examples demonstrating core image processing and computer vision concepts using OpenCV in Python. It covers essential operations for working with images, including:

- **Image Loading and Display:** Opening images using both OpenCV's `imshow` and Matplotlib for diverse display options.
- **Basic Image Manipulations:** Rescaling images, exploring different color spaces (e.g., RGB, HSV), and understanding their applications.
- **Image Analysis:** Generating and visualizing image histograms to analyze pixel intensity distributions.
- **Drawing and Annotation:** Adding text, shapes, and other graphical elements directly onto image windows.
- **Exploring OpenCV Functions:** Implementations of various fundamental OpenCV functions for image manipulation and analysis.
