# Image Segmentation Techniques
This folder contains Python implementations of various fundamental image processing and image segmentation techniques using the OpenCV library. These techniques are crucial for tasks such as image manipulation, feature extraction, object recognition, and preparing images for further analysis in computer vision applications.
Implemented Techniques

## The following concepts and techniques are explored within this repository:
1. **Contours:** Detection and drawing of object boundaries within images.
2. **Center of Mass:** Calculation of the centroid of detected objects or regions using image moments.
3. **Sorting Contours:** Ordering contours based on various criteria, such as size, location (e.g., left-to-right, top-to-bottom), or area.
4. **Convex Hull:** Finding the smallest convex polygon that encloses the points of a contour.
5. **Shape Matching:** Comparing the shapes of different contours to determine their similarity (e.g., using cv2.matchShapes).
6. **Line Detection:** Identifying straight lines within an image, often using the Hough Transform.
7. **Blob Detection:** Identifying regions of pixels (blobs) that differ from their surroundings in properties like color or brightness.
