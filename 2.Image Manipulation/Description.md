# OpenCV Image Processing Techniques

This folder contains Python implementations of various fundamental image processing techniques using the OpenCV library. These techniques are crucial for tasks such as image manipulation, feature extraction, and preparing images for further analysis in computer vision applications.

## Implemented Techniques:

1.  **Translation:** Shifting an image along the X and Y axes.
2.  **Rotation:** Rotating an image around a specified point (e.g., its center) by a given angle.
3.  **Scaling:** Resizing an image to a different dimension, either upscaling or downscaling.
4.  **Cropping:** Extracting a specific region of interest from an image.
5.  **Thresholding:** Converting a grayscale image into a binary image by setting a pixel value threshold.
6.  **Dilation:** A morphological operation that adds pixels to the boundaries of objects in an image, effectively expanding their size.
7.  **Erosion:** A morphological operation that removes pixels from the boundaries of objects in an image, effectively shrinking their size.
8.  **Edge Detection:** Identifying and highlighting the boundaries or edges of objects within an image using algorithms like Canny or Sobel.

## Usage:

Each technique is implemented in a separate script or function, demonstrating its application on sample images. Refer to individual files for detailed code and examples.
